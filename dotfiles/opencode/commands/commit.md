description: Generate commit for staged changes
model: openai/gpt-5.4-mini
---

Create a concise, factual commit message from the staged changes and run the commit once, reporting either the final committed message or the factual failure cause.

## Workflow

1. Run `git diff --cached` to get the staged changes. If empty, print `No staged changes to commit` and stop.
2. Read the diff output to inspect the changes. If large, read in batches.
3. Generate a message using only facts visible in the diff.
4. Run `git commit` with the generated message.

## Rules

- On failure, do not retry, amend, or run corrective commands unless the user asks.
- Format commit messages as `[type]([scope]): [description]` plus an optional body.
- Use one of these types: `feat|fix|refactor|docs|style|test|ci|build|chore|perf`.
- Scope is optional; if present, use modules or domains clearly defined in the project.
- Body is optional; if present, add one blank line after the subject and use bullet points.
- Subject is imperative, has no trailing period or whitespace, and is no more than 50 characters.
- Use lowercase type and English only.

## Output

- On success, print:

  ```text
  Commit successful
  `[final committed message]`
  ```

- On failure, print:

  ```text
  Commit failed
  [brief factual cause from the error output]
  ```
