description: Code review changes or pull requests
---

Perform a focused code review of local changes or a pull request, verify likely issues against the real code, and report only important confirmed findings

## Arguments

```arguments
$ARGUMENTS
```

- **PR number or URL**: Check out and review that pull request.
- **No arguments provided**: Review local changes.
- **Unclear or ambiguous arguments**: Stop and ask the user for clarification before proceeding.

## Workflow

1. Detect review target:
   - If arguments contain PR number/URL, run:
     - `gh pr checkout [number]` (mandatory, so changed files can be inspected in full context)
     - `gh pr view [number] --json title,body,baseRefName` and note the base branch name for the diff
     - Analyze the diff between `HEAD` and `baseRefName`
   - If no arguments:
     - Analyze the diff between `HEAD` and local working tree
2. Follow this verification workflow:
   - From the changes, generate a small set of strong candidate issues. For each candidate, note category, `file:line`, and one-sentence hypothesis.
   - Prefer fewer, stronger candidates; merge duplicate candidates.
   - During verification, read full files and relevant context, try to disprove the hypothesis, and keep only issues introduced or worsened by the current changes.
   - Report only important confirmed findings with concrete evidence.

## Rules

- Review through these lenses: correctness / bugs, security / auth / permissions / input validation / secrets, data integrity / state transitions / idempotency, performance / unbounded work / N+1 / blocking operations, reliability / retries / cleanup / timeouts / concurrency, contracts / schema / API / typing / backward compatibility, and pattern regressions only if they create concrete risk.
- Read the full source file for each candidate, not only the diff.
- Read related tests/imports/exports/interfaces/config and nearby call sites as needed.
- Try to disprove each hypothesis before confirming it.
- Verify whether the issue is introduced or worsened by the current changes.
- Cite only exact line numbers from files actually read.
- Provide concrete evidence and a realistic failure scenario.
- For security findings, identify a plausible trust boundary, attacker path, or missing guard when it creates concrete risk.
- For performance findings, identify the trigger and scaling behavior.
- For pattern-risk findings, explain what established pattern was broken and why it creates concrete risk.
- For internal verification notes, use: `Verdict: CONFIRMED | DISCARDED`, category, severity, title, where, evidence, why it matters, and suggestion.
- If evidence is weak/speculative, or not tied to changed code, mark the candidate `DISCARDED`.
- Include only `CONFIRMED` issues with concrete evidence in the final review.
- Never report pure style feedback, theoretical concerns without evidence, pre-existing issues not introduced or worsened by current changes, or vague pattern complaints without a concrete defect risk.

## Output

If there are no reportable findings, print:

`Looks good to me`

If there are reportable findings, print this structure per finding:

```text
finding: [N]
severity: [severity]
path: [path/to/file:line-range]
[concise evidence and suggestion]
```
