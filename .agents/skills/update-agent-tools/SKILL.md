description: Update curated global/local agent tooling used by these dotfiles. Use when asked to refresh agent CLIs or binaries.

Update the curated agent tools used by this dotfiles repository. This skill updates installed tools only; it must not modify repository files, regenerate generated content, or broaden the tool list by scanning for new commands. Only version is reported per tool — paths are intentionally omitted.

## Scope

Update these tools with these exact methods:

| Tool         | Method                             | Version check          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `playwriter` | `npm install -g playwriter@latest` | `playwriter --version` |
| `rtk`        | `brew upgrade rtk`                 | `rtk --version`        |
| `ctx7`       | `npm install -g ctx7@latest`       | `ctx7 --version`       |
| `skills`     | `npx skills update -g -y`          | `npx skills --version` |

## Workflow

1. Capture the pre-update version for each scoped tool using the version check from the scope table. If the version command fails, record `not found` or `not verifiable`; do not stop.

2. Run every update method from the scope table directly, without asking for confirmation.

3. Continue to the next tool if an update command fails.

4. After `npx skills update -g -y` completes, parse its output to identify which skills were updated (lines matching `✓ Updated <skill-name>`).

5. Capture the post-update version using the same checks as step 1.

6. Return a compact summary for every tool (versions only, no paths). If skills were updated, list which ones.

## Failure Handling

- If `brew upgrade rtk` reports already up-to-date, count that as OK.
- If `brew upgrade rtk` fails (formula unavailable, Homebrew missing, etc.), count only `rtk` as failed and continue.
- If `npm install -g ...` or `npx skills update -g -y` fails, count only the affected tool as failed and continue.
- Version checks are best effort. A failed version check is not an update failure when the update command itself succeeded.

## Output

Return a concise summary with one row per tool:

- tool name
- update method
- status: OK or failed
- version before and after, or `not verifiable`
- any short failure message

If skills were updated, list which ones.
