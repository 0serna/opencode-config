# web-tools-logging Specification

## Purpose

Diagnostic logging for the web-tools extension (web_search, web_fetch), recording Exa API calls and HTTP fallback outcomes in structured JSON format via the shared logger.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Persistent log file location

The system SHALL write diagnostic logs to a persistent location outside of `/tmp`, ensuring logs survive system reboots.

#### Scenario: Default log path

- **WHEN** the tool extension initializes or logs its first event
- **THEN** the log file SHALL be created at `~/.local/state/pi/web-tools.log`

#### Scenario: Parent directory created automatically

- **WHEN** the log directory does not exist at first write
- **THEN** the system SHALL create the parent directory (`~/.local/state/pi/`) automatically

### Requirement: Log size management

The system SHALL manage the log file size to prevent unbounded growth on disk.

#### Scenario: Trim oldest entries when over limit

- **WHEN** the log file exceeds 2000 lines
- **THEN** the system SHALL truncate the file to keep only the most recent 2000 lines, discarding the oldest entries

### Requirement: Structured log format

Each log entry SHALL follow a consistent format to support automated parsing (grep, tail, scripts).

#### Scenario: Timestamp prefix

- **WHEN** any event is logged
- **THEN** the entry SHALL start with an ISO 8601 timestamp followed by a space, then the source, event, and fields

#### Scenario: JSON data

- **WHEN** an event includes additional data (URL, status, count, etc.)
- **THEN** the data SHALL be encoded as a JSON object appended after the event name

### Requirement: Success and failure logging for Exa Search

The system SHALL log both successful and failed Exa Search API calls.

#### Scenario: Log successful search

- **WHEN** `web_search` completes successfully via Exa
- **THEN** the system SHALL log the event with the query and result count

#### Scenario: Log failed search

- **WHEN** `web_search` fails (API error, timeout, etc.)
- **THEN** the system SHALL log the event with the query and error information

### Requirement: Success and failure logging for Exa Contents

The system SHALL log both successful and failed Exa Contents API calls.

#### Scenario: Log successful content fetch

- **WHEN** `web_fetch` retrieves content successfully via Exa Contents
- **THEN** the system SHALL log the event with the URL, status tag, and content length

#### Scenario: Log failed content fetch with error tag

- **WHEN** `web_fetch` fails via Exa Contents (crawl error, timeout, not found)
- **THEN** the system SHALL log the event with the URL and the specific error tag from the Exa `statuses` response field (e.g., `CRAWL_NOT_FOUND`, `CRAWL_TIMEOUT`)

### Requirement: HTTP fallback outcome logging

The system SHALL log the outcome of the HTTP fallback extraction when Exa Contents fails.

#### Scenario: Log successful HTTP fallback

- **WHEN** Exa Contents fails and the HTTP fallback succeeds
- **THEN** the system SHALL log the event with the URL and byte count of extracted content

#### Scenario: Log failed HTTP fallback

- **WHEN** both Exa Contents and the HTTP fallback fail
- **THEN** the system SHALL log the event with the URL and the error message
